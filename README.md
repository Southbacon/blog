# Southbacon Blog!

## Creating new Blog Entries
1. Create a new branch with the title of your new entry.
2. Create your new entry inside of the `src/pages/` directory. (New name of post should probably be formatted like this: `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title`.)
3. Commit your entry.
4. Create a new pull request against the master branch.
5. Once 2 other people in the community have reviewed your entry, it will be merged in.
6. Someone who has permission to publish the new entry to the gh-pages branch can then build and deploy the new entry.

## Developing locally and to review how your new blog entry looks on the rendered site:
1. Clone this repository, cd into the new site directory and and run `npm install`.
2. Run `gatsby develop` or `npm run develop`.
