# I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo.

Kif might! They're like sex, except I'm having them! Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long.

Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. __Guards!__ *Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!* In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.

## But existing is basically all I do!

Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. Can we have Bender Burgers again? Your best is an idiot! I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan!

1. I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!
2. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here.
3. Ow, my spirit!

### In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.

No! The cat shelter's on to me. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?
